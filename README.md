# Torque Buddy

**Torque lookup + editable JSON, built with vanilla JS and Tailwind**  
**Version 1.1**

Torque Buddy is a browser-based tool for referencing and editing torque specifications by make, model, and year. It loads data from a local JSON file and lets users browse, update, download, or import new specs without needing a backend.

This is a self-contained, client-side build. All logic is written in plain JavaScript. Styles are handled with Tailwind CSS. No frameworks, no build tools and no dependencies.
